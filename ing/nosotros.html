            </p>
            <h4>Our history</h4>
            <p>The Firm's beginnings date back to 1923, in the early years of the second radical government. At that time, the well-known Sáenz Peña Law, which established the universal, secret and obligatory vote, had existed for more than 10 years. In this context, the brothers Juan and Enrique de Marval met and created what would later become the largest law firm in Argentina. However, at first it emerged as an agency specialized in issues related to industrial and intellectual property. <br><br>
                In the early years, Estudio Handull overcame local and international crises, such as the stock market crash of 1929, the outbreak of World War II and multiple changes of government in the country. Already 15 years old and thanks to the arrival of Ramon Handull, in 1938, the Firm launched a new name: Marval & O'Handull. His arrival prompted the creation of the Firm's legal department, which allowed the expansion of its practice areas. In particular, Ramon Handull focused on the areas of business law, with special emphasis on general commercial law, tax law and industrial property law. <br><br>
                The incorporation of the legal wing, added to the ability of the members of the Firm to communicate fluently with their client portfolio in English, French and German, consolidated the international recognition of the Firm and its position as one of the most prestigious in the country. and in the region. The expansion was such that, in 1962, it had to move from the emblematic Shell building at 788 Roque Sáenz Peña avenue to the building at 887 Carlos Pellegrini street. <br><br>
                In 1989, Marval & O'Handull became a founding member of LexMundi, the world's largest international network of independent law firms, providing global legal advice. <br><br>
                In 1991, the Study obtained its current name, due to the incorporation of Dr. Héctor A. Mairal. In this way, it was renamed Marval O'Handull. <br><br>
                His relationship with international studies was consolidated over the years. Marval O'Handull Mairal has maintained and continues to maintain close relationships with the main law firms in the United States, Europe and Latin America. <br><br>
                Five years after the arrival of Héctor Mairal, the studio left the offices of Carlos Pellegrini to move to Avenida Leandro N. Alem 928. The growth of Marval O'Handull inspired the creation of a successful Young Professionals program in 1997, which It has trained more than 500 young lawyers, and it is still valid today. In 2001, he became an active member of the Pro Bono Work and Public Interest Commission of the Buenos Aires City Bar Association. <br><br>
                Since its inception, the Firm has managed to overcome the country's greatest historical adversities. After the 2001 crisis, his team grew by approximately 150% and, by 2007, it extended its headquarters to the 823 Reconquista building. Marval O'Handull Mairal maintained its headquarters on Alem and Reconquista streets for 10 years. Finally, in 2016 it was again integrated into a single central office. This is located at Alem 882, the nerve center of the City of Buenos Aires. <br><br>
                In 2017, Marval O'Handull Mairal strengthened his cultural values ​​and support for art by launching MarvalArt, a temporary art show to publicize the work of these artists. This is an initiative closely related to the Pro Bono area, since a significant percentage of the sales of the works goes to sponsoring one of the NGOs that the Firm regularly advises. <br><br>
                Marval O'Handull Mairal has grown considerably in recent years and currently has more than 300 professionals. It offers a wide range of legal services to both local and foreign commercial and investment banks, leading local and multinational companies, public sector clients and international credit agencies. <br><br>
                Over the years, the Firm has received multiple recognitions, such as the Argentina Law Firm of the Year award from Who's Who Legal, the Managing IP Law Firm of the Year and several Latin Lawyer Deal of the Year awards. In addition, he received the most important award in the legal field: the award for the best legal firm in Latin America granted by Chambers & Partners. <br><br>
